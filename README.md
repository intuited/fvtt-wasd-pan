## WASD Pan

**Version**: 0.1.0

**Author**: [Ted Tibbetts][tt]

**Source Repository**: [github][gh]

### Description
WASD-Pan provides the ability to pan the view by using the WASD keys on the keyboard
as an alternative to using CTRL-arrow keys or the mouse.

Currently this functionality is locked in whenever the module is enabled;
in the future an option will be added so each player can select this configuration if desired.

### Compatibility
* Foundry: Tested on v. 11.307

### Functionality
- Changes functionality of WASD keys to pan the view instead of moving the selected token(s).
- Arrow keys will still initiate token movement.
- FUTURE: add option so players can disable this functionality if desired.

### Installation

Use the green Code dropdown in [github][gh] to choose your preferred download method.
Place the code in your `foundrydata` directory at `Data/modules/wasd-pan`.
